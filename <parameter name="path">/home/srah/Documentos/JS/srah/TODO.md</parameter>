<parameter name="content"># Calendar Project - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ REMOVED - Unused Import in calendar.js
- **Issue**: `uiManager` was imported but never used in calendar.js
- **Fix**: Removed the unused import to eliminate circular dependency

### 2. ✅ FIXED - Duplicate Event Handlers on Calendar Days
- **Issue**: Both calendar.js and ui.js attached click listeners to day cells causing duplicate modal openings
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed click listener from calendar.js `createDayCell()` method
  - Added `data-date` attribute to cells for event delegation
  - Added centralized click handler in ui.js using event delegation pattern

### 3. ✅ FIXED - Inconsistent Calendar Rendering
- **Issue**: Both calendar.js and ui.js had duplicate calendar rendering logic (renderCalendar, createDayElement)
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed duplicate methods from ui.js that already exist in calendar.js
  - uiManager now calls calendarManager.init() for calendar rendering
  - uiManager navigation methods now delegate to calendarManager

### 4. ✅ FIXED - Missing Opening JSDoc Comment in ui.js
- **Issue**: ui.js file was missing the opening `/**` on the first line
- **Fix**: Added the missing `/**` to start the JSDoc comment properly

### 5. ✅ FIXED - getState() Method Safety in main.js
- **Issue**: getState() could fail if managers weren't initialized
- **Fix**: Added null checks and safe defaults before accessing manager methods

### 6. ✅ FIXED - Removed setupStrictMode() method in main.js
- **Issue**: The `'use strict';` inside a function had no effect
- **Fix**: Removed the redundant method (ES modules are already in strict mode)

### 7. ✅ FIXED - Missing Null Check in showError() method
- **Issue**: Could fail if `<main>` element wasn't found
- **Fix**: Added null check before using mainElement

### 8. ✅ FIXED - Removed duplicate calendar rendering in init()
- **Issue**: Both calendarManager.init() and uiManager.renderCalendar() were called
- **Fix**: uiManager.init() now only calls calendarManager.init() once

## Files Modified:
1. js/calendar/calendar.js - Removed unused import, removed click listener, added data-date attribute
2. js/ui/ui.js - Fixed missing JSDoc, added centralized click handler, removed duplicate methods, delegate to calendarManager
3. js/main.js - Improved error handling and safety checks
4. js/utils/utils.js - Minor code cleanup

## Status: ALL ISSUES FIXED ✅

The calendar application now has:
- No circular dependencies
- Single source of truth for calendar rendering
- Centralized event handling for day clicks
- Proper null checks and error handling
- Clean, maintainable code structure
